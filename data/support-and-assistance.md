### Workgroups

You can find the schedule of the workgroups in **Brightspace (Content - Overview)** or in your personal scheduler:

#### Discord

You can also send messages to the TAs and teachers via the Discord server of the course. Use the link provided in the course manual to join the server.

Despite the fact that workgroups are not mandatory, attending them is a good opportunity to interact with the TAs and your fellow students. Make sure to make use of that!
